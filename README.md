# ðŸ“‘LLM - Detect AI Generated Text - with RoBERTa

This project aims to develop robust and accurate methods for detecting AI-generated text, utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. By delving into the nuances of language patterns, syntactic structures, and semantic cues, our goal is to create a tool that can reliably identify instances where text originates from AI models.

For this project we will use a dataset that cantains around 10,000 essays written by humans and by AI generated text.

The dataset set was taken from Kaggle, it is a collection of many essays prepared for a Kaggle competition, here is the [link.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-proper-train-dataset/data?select=train_drcat_04.csv)
